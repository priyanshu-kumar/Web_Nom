I have created 3 files performing folloeing operations-
guestbook.php- It provides the input space having "name", "email", "dat of birth" and directs the input data to update_guestbook.php
update_guestbook.php- It gets the data from guestbook inserts into database "web_nom" having tbel"entrt" on server:localhost,username:root and finally directs to view_guestbook.php
view_guestbook.php- it asks email, if correct then prints name email and date of birth else prints no entry found and provides link for guestbook.php
