                                I have created 3 files performing following operations-
                                
1.guestbook.php- It provides the input space having "name", "email", "dat of birth" and directs the input data to update_guestbook.php
2.update_guestbook.php- It gets the data from guestbook inserts into database "web_nom" having tbel"entrt" on      server:localhost,username:root and finally directs to view_guestbook.php
3.view_guestbook.php- it asks email, if correct then prints name email and date of birth else prints no entry found and provides link for    guestbook.php
